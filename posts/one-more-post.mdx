title: Mental models for designers
description: "Think about the first thing you do when you pick up a new mobile phone or click on a new website. Do you have a certain expectation when you swipe across the mobile screen or scan the navigation at the top of the webpage for the first time?

If you answered yes, that means you have a mental model of how those user interfaces work. When we engage with the world, our brains are constantly organizing the information we encounter into cognitive representations, which are called mental models.

Creating mental models in our heads for anything and everything makes a lot of sense. Mental models prevent us from having to figure things out from scratch every time we have a new experience. They give us the tools we need to make inferences and come to conclusions quickly—including digital products or new technologies.

When it comes to UX design, one of the biggest goals for any project should be to uncover users’ mental models. Understanding your users’ mental models will help you make design choices that will be intuitive and engaging for them."
