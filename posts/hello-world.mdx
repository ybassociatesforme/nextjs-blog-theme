description: "Knowing that users will refer to their existing mental models is valuable to UX designers. Understanding users’ mental models will help you get an idea of what users will expect from the system when you’re planning your project’s UX."

If you don’t adhere to user’s existing mental models, there will be a mismatch between the user’s idea of how a product will work and the way it actually works. This mismatch can cause all sorts of problems because it will lead to user frustration, and often, users will abandon your app or website, or decide against buying your mobile phone or tablet.

The good thing is that while people’s mental models are often different, when it comes to user experiences for familiar user interfaces (or UIs) like websites, a majority of people develop similar mental models for common user experiences.

For example, if a person is going to a new website to buy something, they will have a mental model of how the check out experience on the new website will work based on their past experiences with online shopping. If the new check out sequence is consistent with their mental model, the user will smoothly navigate through it and feel satisfied with their experience.
